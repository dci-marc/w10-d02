## Exercise 1:

1. create a similar class to the Teacher class for student
2. should have the following fields: String name, String course, String city, boolean isEuropean, int id
3. Write a method in the Student class that will display the user information in the terminal if they are in the java course: printStudentInfo()
4. otherwise it should print "Sorry, but we only allow students of the java course, Try again some other time"
5. BONUS: compare in the method the string for course case-insensitive (meaning "java" == "Java")
6. BONUS 2: have the ids automatically increase with each new student without having to input the ids
